  """Selects using indices group_sizes the relevant values for a parameter.

  Given a parameter vector (or possibly constant) that describes values
  for groups of size 1,2,...., k_max selects values according to vector
  group_sizes. When an item in group_sizes is larger than the size of
  the vector, we revert to the last element of the vector by default.

  Note that the values array is 0-indexed, therefore the values corresponding
  to size 1 is values[0], to size 2 values[1] and more generally, the value for
  a group of size i is values[i-1].

  Args:
    values: a np.ndarray that can be of size 1 or more, from which to seleect
     the values from.
    sizes: np.array[int] representing the group sizes we want to extract the
     values of.

  Returns:
    vector of parameter values, chosen at corresponding group sizes,
    of the same size of group_sizes.

  Raises:
   ValueError when the size array is not one dimensional.
