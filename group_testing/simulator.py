  A simulator takes a wetlab that returns can test patients, a policy to select

  Attributes:
   metrics: the current metrics of the simulation.

   sampler: the main sampler of the simulator, since it can have two samplers,
    one only used to compute marginals.

    patient.
   is_over: (bool) True if the simulation is over, else otherwise.
